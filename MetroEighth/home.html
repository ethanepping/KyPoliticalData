                        <p>Another election has come and gone!  Democracy is still alive and kicking in the commonwealth of Kentucky.  There were several races that were very exciting to watch during this primary, but the Louisville Metro Council District 8 race provided extra exhilaration.  District 8 is my district.  It represents the Highlands: it begins at the intersection of the Watterson and Bardstown Road, and run along the Bardstown/Baxter corridor until Broadway.  Since the inception of the Metro Council in 2003, the District has only been represented by the legendary Tom Owen.  When Councilman Owen announced he would not seek re-election, many expected the race to be full of well qualified liberal candidates.  We were not disappointed--seven people ran in this race.</p>
                        <p>On election night, there was high drama.  There weren&#39t any public polls for this race, so watchers depended on yard signs and mailers to gauge the race.  It became clear fairly quickly after results started arriving that the race was between Brandon Coan, Stephen Reily, and Chris Kolb.  Once most of the results arrived, Mr. Coan and Mr. Reily had separated themselves from the other candidates.  When there was one precinct left, Courier-Journal writer sent out the following tweet:</p>

                        <p>This tweet got me thinking (my <a href="https://twitter.com/rkahne/status/732721213118795777">snarky response</a> notwithstanding).  From which neighborhoods did each candidate pull their support?  So, like a good data analyst, I put together some maps.  The carousel above shows how each candidate performed in the District.  It turns out that Mr. Bailey was indeed correct: Steven Reily did get most of the vote in the Cherokee Triangle.</p>
                        <p>To me, there are many interesting notes in this data. For some candidates, support was dispersed very widely throughout, and for others, their support was concentrated.  The top five candidates did relatively well in specific parts of the district: Mr. Reily won in the northeast corner, dominated by the Cherokee Triangle.  Mr. Coan won the southeast corner, where Bowman field is located. Mr. Kolb had the advantage in the southwest corner where Atherton and Bellarmine are.  Ms. Meyer showed strength south of that, along the Gardiner Lane corridor.  Ms. Long showed perhaps the most interesting results, with support among all the districts without a particular region of strength.</p>
                        <p>There are other interesting observations to be made with this data.  Feel free to get in touch with me using my contact information below!  I&#39m happy to share source code and methodology with anyone who asks.  Also--please note that the data which I used appears to be missing information for precincts G151 and M165.  If I find that at any point, I&#39ll be sure to add it into the analysis.</p>

                        <p>A Smart Idea was to also include a map of the winners by precinct.  The above map ONLY shows where candidates were strong--not who won in what precinct.  So, here is that map:</p>
